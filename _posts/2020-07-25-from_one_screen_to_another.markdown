"Why did I decide to learn software development", you ask? 

I studied for many years with the hopes of becoming an *orchestral musician* (oooh aahhh). While no suprise to me, you should know that no one is guaranteed a job as a musician. 

I grew up knowing many professional musicians that made their livings with "portfolio careers", or what I call "musiciands" (musican and...[bicycle repairman, teachers, bankers, repair techs, ice cream shop owners, etc.]). Me? I am a professional musician AND orchestra adminstrator. Which was maybe not the smartest idea, but more on that later. 

I was very lucky to have positive work experiences both on and off the stage, and found that I had a certain affinity for the non-performance aspects of orchestral music. I gained experience during the summers by interning at organtiztions and working for classical music festivals, and when my last performance degree was nearing it's bitter end, I thought "I needed an job!" I applied, on a whim, for a lower-level position at a prestigious, top-tier orchestra and was offered the job.

I worked for a couple years in that position, and felt I brought a lot to the organization, but was frustrated by the lack of upward mobility and total absence of work-life balance. An opening in a higher position that allowed for a better balance and more opportunities for creativity opened up, so I applied and got the promotion.

Enter **PANDEMIC** (less than three months into my new job)

Remember how I said maybe it wasn't the smartest idea? Well, heres why. 

The entire arts world is being rocked (more than usual) by financial hardship and uncertainty, and I put all my eggs in one basket. I still have a family to support and as a Type-1 dieabetic decent health insurance is a must (have you seen how much insulin costs in the US?!). It was time to think about making a shift.

The problem is my training and expereince on the surface is pretty niche, or at least non-arts organizations seem to feel that way. So what's a guy to do? 

Enter CODING

I remembered a musician colleague was doing some part-time online coding bootcamp a few months back, so I reached out to him to see how it was going and pick his brain on the process. He said it was "The Flatiron School" and that he was employed at a start-up! That fueled me to do some reading, and watched what seemed like 100s of videos on coding bootcamps and potential career paths. 

I was immediately drawn by the creativity it requires, the growth mindset needed to suceed (go read "Mindset" by Carol Dweck), and constant innovation inherent to the industry. I thought, "I can do this! I might even really enjoy it!"

So that is why I am here.

Just looking for a new "and..."

**TL;DR: I'm a professional musician and arts administrator looking for a more sustainable career.**
